I was inspired to create my own pumpkin lasagna by combinding two recipes I found online. The result was well worth the effort!
<h6> Ingredients</h6>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh sage</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds sliced baby bella mushrooms</li>
<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
<li> 2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
<li> 3 cups pumpkin puree</li>
<li> 12 lasagna noodles</li>
<li> 1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
<li> 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li> 2 tablespoons butter</li>
</ul>

<h6> Steps</h6>
<ol>
<li> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
<li> Mix sage, salt, black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cloves together in a small bowl to make a spice blend.</li>
<li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, and 1/2 of the spice blend; cook and stur until mushrooms are tender and all moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Combine 2 cups pumpkin piree, 1/2 cp parmesan cheese and remaining spice blend in a bowl.</li>
<li> Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles in the bottom so they slightly overlap. Cover with 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture and 1/2 of the mushroom mixture. Dot with 1/2 cup ricotta; sprinkle 1/2 cup mozarella cheese on top. 
    Repeat layers once more. Place remaining 4 noodles on top.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 miutes. Uncover and bake untill bubbly, about 15 minutes more.</li>

</ol>
